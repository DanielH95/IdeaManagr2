## Use the Visual Studio Code terminals to do you work ##

NOTE: Ensure that you have opened Visual Studio Code in the PROJECT folder,
      and not in backend/frontend folders specifically.


SET UP 3 TERMINALS:

1. Ensure you have the first terminal (1) free, and pointing to 'frontend/' (to do this: cd frontend/).
2. Add ANOTHER terminal (+ button) to have a second terminal (2), and pointing to 'backend/' (to do this: cd backend/).
3. Add ANOTHER terminal again to have a third terminal (3), and leave it pointing as it is (PROJECT folder).


RUN COMMANDS IN GIVEN ORDER:

4. In terminal 3, run the command:

5. In terminal 2, run the command:
    nodemon

6. In terminal 1, run the command:
