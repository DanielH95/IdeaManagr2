## To Do Jobs for this app ##


> JOB 1:  - STATUS: Incomplete -
  Merge current components (ideas & idea-content) to match the new routing components (list & edit & create) and replace safely.

    - '/list' should display all the ideas in the left sidebar ul element - COMPLETE
      --> NOTE: This should completely replace the 'ideas' component when everything in this job is complete

    - '/edit' should display the content of the SELECTED (clicked) item in the main-content display area
      --> NOTE: This should/hopefully completely replace the 'idea-content' component when everything in this job is complete

    - '/create' should display a new frontend SPA 'page' upon clicking the 'Add an Idea' button to fulfill a post request
      --> NOTE: If this isn't working, or not preferred, perhaps make the route respond to the on-page 'add' button as before?


> JOB 2:  - STATUS: Incomplete -
  Consider naming conventions of all routing - EXAMPLE: do we really want "https://IdeaManagr/list" instead of "https://IdeaManagr/dashboard"
  for our list of ideas (the main application page, remember!).


> JOB 3:  - STATUS: Incomplete -
  Route the other non-application pages into the website (Homepage, account, etc).
  

> JOB 4:  - STATUS: Incomplete -
  Incorporate authentication (look back at Colt's passport stuff?). Perhaps consider how to incorporate the database schemas that will show
  unique content depending on the user (not everyone is meant to see the same exact ideas).
